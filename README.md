# UprojectBackend
Hi! ðŸ‘‹.

I guess if u are here u already know what Uproject is, but in case you dont know, feel free to check it out here https://github.com/Dominguezd01/Uproject

But in this repo we are not talking about the UI this is going to be the backend of my project. Im still thinking which database IÂ´m gonna use so if you have 

any advice that could be helpful for the type of app that im working on, feel free to contact me. You have my Twitter acc in my bio and also here https://twitter.com/Dominguezd01_.

The only thing I know at this point is that this project will use Node Js and Express as IÂ´m already doing research to find out which technologies use.

IÂ´ll keep you guys posted on this project, see you soon.
